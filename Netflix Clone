In this project, I developed a Netflix clone utilizing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the frontend, and integrated Firebase for the login and signup database.
The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. Users can browse through a collection of movies, and upon selecting a video, they are directed to the trailer of the chosen movie.
Additionally, there is a straightforward navigation option to return to the home page, providing a user-friendly interface and a smooth viewing experience.
